Join us for the 4th annual GoGaRuCo!

EuRuKo is an annual conference about the Ruby language with an informal atmosphere and lots of opportunities to listen, to talk, to hack and to have fun.




Sponsoring the Golden Gate Ruby Conference is a great way to get access to the top Ruby talent in San Francisco, and from around the world. Whether your goals are recruiting, brand awareness, developer adoption, or anything else, we bring together several hundred highly qualified engineers, in an intimate, network-heavy environment.
